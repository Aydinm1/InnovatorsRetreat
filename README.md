🌟 Innovators Retreat

The Innovators Retreat System was built to manage participants, sessions, bios, and communications for a multi-day retreat.
It combined Airtable, custom automations, interfaces, and personalized emails into one unified system that made retreat operations seamless.

📖 Overview

Running a global retreat requires more than just a spreadsheet — it requires a system that can:

Track participant records and session RSVPs

Collect and update participant bios

Automate routine communications

Provide interfaces for organizers to work efficiently

Keep data synced across all stakeholders

This platform achieved exactly that.
